### Hi! I'm Siam. Here's a glimpse of what's inside my brain ðŸ§ 

Software Developer with a focus on building sustainable and efficient code. I love developing interactive experiences as well that bridge the gap between function and aesthetic. More often than not, I'm frustrated by the lack of good design but efficient code, or the opposite, great design and spaghetti code, and I'm here to fix that. I also love doing Game Dev on the side and one of my passions is to actually build a game-dev studio at some point in my life.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# for the Game Dev projects.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a game or build a game together using a popular game engine.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with fullstack development or development in C#.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: efficiency, game dev, algorithms and data structures and of course, Lord of the Rings.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've watched the LOTR trilogy 42 times. 

*There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.*
